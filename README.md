# Neural-Network-from-Scratch
Building a Neural Network from scratch in Python with minimal library useage.

Follow step-by-step instructions of creating a Neural Network from scratch in */nnfs_steps*.
Important concepts can be found in */concepts*.

Dependencies are listed in *environment.yml*

## Setup
* run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
* activate env via `conda activate <env name>`
* run `pip install nnfs`

## Neural Network from
Each step builds on previous step and adds a new concept:
01. Single layer calculation of a Neural Network (NN)
02. Single layer calculation of a NN
    * added numpy
03. Single layer calculation of a NN
    * added batch input
04. Multi layer calculation of a NN
05. Multi layer calculation of a NN
    * added OOP
06. Multi layer calculation of a NN
    * added activation function for first layer
07. Multi layer calculation of a NN
    * added activation function for output layer (softmax)
08. Multi layer calculation of a NN
    * added loss function
